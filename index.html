		<h2>Have we given the wrong credits of the cacao?</h2>
		<p>In 1828, a Dutch chemist discovered a way to make powdered chocolate. He did this by separating about half of the natural fat (cacao butter) from the chocolate liquor and then grinding what was left and combining it with alkaline salts to curb the bitter taste. This gentlemen’s product became known as “Dutch Cocoa”. However, the credit for making the first chocolate bar is given to Joseph Fry, who discovered that one could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding the melted cacao butter back into the “Dutch Cacao”. By 1868, Cadbury jumped on board and began to market boxes of chocolate candies in England.</p>
